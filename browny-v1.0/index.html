								I initially applied to 2 programs at various universities which are; AFM (Accounting and
								Financial Management) and Software Engineering. At the time, I thought AFM was for me,
								but my parents urged me to also apply to Software Engineering. Over the last couple
								months, this class has changed my mind. Last week, I accepted an offer for Software
								Engineering at Western University.
							</h3>
							<p>
								I struggled at the beginning of this class without our teacher, and relying on supply
								teachers that changed frequently. However, Mr. Brown was graciously willing to make some
								time and teach us. This motivates me to make something out of a situation like this.
								Spending countless hours on programming and non-programming assignments sparked an
								interest in the future of technology and its impact. I learned advanced programming
								concepts which encouraged me to begin studying more complex algorithms and data
								structures. The environment of this class has been different from other classes to say
								the least. It has helped me be more efficient with my independent work and build my
								initiative skills. Having lots of time to spend on assignments and projects to help me
								hone my skills. It is an approach to learning that I have never experienced before and I
								am thankful for it.

							<h3>
								We initially were going to create a system where a patient books an appointment online,
								walks in and gets their face scanned by a camera. Then their medical history and their
								appointment details would show up on a computer monitored by a secretary. This idea
								stemmed from our experiences with long lines at clinics, emergency care, etc. Especially
								in Canada where healthcare is free, this seemed to solve a real world issue. However
								this made lots of sense theoretically, but practically, it was impossible. Finding a
								framework to help match what we want didn’t work. We would have to get access to every
								citizen’s files in Canada from the government to make it work. If not, we can just use
								the information they fill out online. However, how will we know that the information is
								accurate? So we scratched the idea and moved on to a program that helps with posture
								detection. Trying to stay on the topic of solving real life issues. This idea really
								came to surface after the Environmental Impact Presentation. We went into detail on the
								effect computers have on us mentally and physically. Computers cause poor posture like
								slouching/hunching, bad screen alignment, and incorrect use of chairs which can affect
								your muscle joints, and musculoskeletal issues. Spending long hours on computers like 7+
								hours will create stiffness and muscle soreness. This causes lack of movement because
								you are maintaining one position with little to no breaks. The brightness (poor
								lighting, blue light exposure, and screen resolution) and viewing distance (font size,
								screen and position) creates eye strain. 68% of people without an ergonomic setup have
								had musculoskeletal injuries which is potentially caused by doing the same task
								repeatedly, causing stress on nerves and tendons. 20% of people without an ergonomic
								setup have had carpal tunnel syndrome which is a nerve in the wrist that is used
								repeatedly with wrong equipment. 60-85% of people without an ergonomic setup have muscle
								strain. We came to the conclusion that your ergonomic workstation should have solutions
								to all the physical, posture related problems that it is causing. First, the screen
								needs to be tilted slightly upward with the top of the screen at eye-level, and around
								45-60cm away. Second, the environment needs to meet your needs, including the air
								circulation, temperature, cleanliness, and room for your legs. Third, the chair needs to
								be able to recline slightly, helping you to sit back causing your thighs to be parallel
								to the floor. Fourth, the keyboard and mouse need to be at elbow height with your
								fingers making a 90 degree angle, using your elbows and not your wrist to maneuver
								around, and having your shoulders relaxed. However, this is easier said than done. A
								study showed that someone on their laptop who really tried not to touch their face with
								their hands (study was done during covid to prevent the spread), ended up touching their
								face 16 times in one hour. Trying to fix a really strong habit is almost impossible, so
								my group and I created something that will remind you that your posture needs to be
								fixed. </h3>
							<p>
								Our program is pretty straightforward. It uses your camera system in your computer to
								calculate the distance between you and the camera using the parameters of your head and
								shoulders. If that distance is relatively far (if distance < 0.5), then you are not
									hunching over and your posture is good. When it is between a certain distance (if
									distance=0.5), the video feed flashes yellow, giving you a warning that your posture
									needs to be fixed. If the distance is very minimal (very close to the screen and if
									distance> 0.5), the screen flashes red with lots of red text on the screen, and
									plays a very loud noise. This only happens after 1-2 minutes because we are aware
									sometimes you just want to see something close up or point at the screen to show
									something. We showed it to Mr. Brown in class, and it is in fact very obnoxious. You
									can see a detailed summary of your posture in Real-Time Plot. This creates a graph
									comparing distance with time. Using the parameters, it calculates the distance and
									tells you when you are slouching. This is a separate application that runs in the
									background. </p>

													X and Y Parameters
												</h4>
												<h5>By: Neelesh</h5>
												<p class="description">
													In this directory, we are calculating the x and y parameters using 2
													points for the y values and 2 points for the x value. The program
													finds the distance between each x and y and returns a positive value
													between 0-1. However, if one doesn’t exist at the moment, then it
													returns a negative value. Then using the double functions and if
													statement, it multiples each value by 2, checks if they are valid
													(if not, then returns and error value), then calculates the
													distance. <i>x2 - x1 and y2 - y1</i> is calculating the difference
													between the x and y values. <i>std::pow(x2 - x1, 2) and std::pow(y2
														- y1, 2)</i> is computing the squares of those values.
													<i>std::pow(x2 - x1, 2) + std::pow(y2 - y1, 2)</i> adds the squares
													of the differences. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of
													the squares of the differences in the coordinates gives the square
													of the distance between the two points. <i>std::sqrt(...)</i>
													computes the square root of the value inside the parentheses. Taking
													the square root of the sum of the squares gives the Euclidean
													distance between the two points.

													It uses the variables and sees if it is greater than the threshold
													or less. This identifies if the person is slouching or not. <i>bool
														is_slouching(double distance, double threshold)</i> declares a
													function named <i>is_slouching</i> which returns a boolean value
													(true or false). The function takes two parameters: <i>distance</i>
													and <i>threshold</i>, both of type <i>double</i>. <i>return distance
														> threshold;</i> is the body of the function. It evaluates the
													expression <i>distance > threshold</i>. If <i>distance</i> is
													greater than <i>threshold</i>, the expression evaluates to
													<i>true</i>. If <i>distance</i> is less than or equal to
													<i>threshold</i>, the expression evaluates to <i>false<i>. The
															result of this comparison (<i>true</i> or <i>false</i>) is

													<i>if (distance > threshold)</i> this outer if statement checks if

										The coding project that we brainstormed required frameworks. Frameworks that are cross platform and are multi-modal (video, audio, and sensor data). MediaPipe was perfect for that. It is used for real-time perception like estimating live, hand tracking, face detection, and other vision applications. MediaPipe is designed to perform real-time processing on both mobile devices and desktops. The framework is highly modular, allowing developers to use pre-built components (such as pose estimation or object detection models) or create their own custom components. MediaPipe supports multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux). Learning what MediaPipe is and how to use it was my biggest accomplishment during the project because it has opened the world to a bunch of other frameworks that I can use for future projects.

										I have an idea of creating frameworks that benefit me in specific projects and the public as well. The level of complexity of future projects have risen a lot, but I enjoy the challenge. In the future, I want to incorporate AI into my projects. Similar to almost every application nowadays, AI has been more popular than ever. I would have to understand the basics of AI, choosing the right tools and frameworks, finding the purpose for the AI, developing a model and training, integrating, deploying and maintaining it.

							<h3>With all the assignments I had during this class, I figured that organization would help me do better on these assignments. So I created a Gantt Chart that helped organize what I would do and when. At first, it was difficult because I didn’t realize that I spend more time than I need to. I go above and beyond in researching and try to perfect every little detail. Some assignments really fascinated me like Emerging Technology, Careers in Tech, and the Programming Project too. I developed such an interest, that when I was working on the assignments, I didn’t realize that it had been hours. My friends made jokes about how I spent hours on an assignment that they just spent 30 minutes on and got a better mark for it. However, the knowledge that they gained from that assignment was little to none, whereas I really understood the specifics.</h3>
							<p>That also came from the process of brainstorming to researching to deploying and finally presenting. My initial idea for the presentations and videos are completely different from what we submit. When an assignment is first given to us, I immediately write down my key ideas. If I am in a group, we research and talk about what we should go with. I really enjoy working with others because they are able to notice where I went wrong and I am able to do the same for them. Once we have the content, I am usually the person who designs the slideshow or the overall structure of the video. With the help of my group, we are able to put all our parts together and create a final product. This process has taught me how to work well with others and make their best come to life.</p>
